      <description>In March I attended the event Three Decades of Quantitative Criminology at Manchester hosted by my colleagues David Buil-Gil and Thiago Oliveira. The event focused on teaching and research, and as one of the last speakers I wanted to look forward, and explore how current changes to the academic landscape might influence our research and teaching.
Specifically I wanted to explore how generative AI tools, like chatGPT are going to affect how we teach statistics to our criminology undergraduates.</description>

      <description>Last week I was in Harrogate, UK for the 30th Environmental Criminology and Crime Analysis (ECCA) meeting. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been to an in-person conference since ASC 2019. Usually to help me focus, I take notes, and the ASC notes (linked above) were appreciated by some, so I decided to type up also my ECCA notes. Here are some of my thoughts/ what I learned grouped them into some key themes for a summary.</description>

      <description>Writing is a big part of my job. I write lectures, papers, book chapters (&amp;hellip;book!), presentations, grant applications, blog entries, feedback, emails, reports, reference letters, and probably a bunch of other things. Yupp, a lot of my job involves writing. But just because I write a lot, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I&amp;rsquo;m any good at it. I can&amp;rsquo;t be that bad, I do have citations of my work, but there is always scope to improve.</description>

      <description>I had the chance to attend an in-person conference organised by Peak: Altitude X. The conference aimed to bring together business and data communities, and I also snuck in as an undercover academic.
My sneaking in was facilitated very kindly by Her+Data Manchester, so I want to say a big big thank you for this opportunity!
Highlights I wanted to quickly write up the main highlights (besides catching up with people in-person) for me.</description>

      <title>On Outliers</title>

      <description>In exploratory data analysis, we talk about getting to know our data through measures of central tendency (mean, median, weighted mean, weighted median), and measures of spread (range, interquartile range, variance, standard deviation). It is at this time that students of data analysis get introduced to the concept of &amp;ldquo;outliers&amp;rdquo;. However, at this point, depending on the textbook and/or discipline used, they might encounter different definitions of what is an outlier, and different techniques for addressing these outliers.</description>

      <description>This blog post is about the full paper: Ceccato V, Solymosi R, Müller O. The Use of Twitter by Police Officers in Urban and Rural Contexts in Sweden. International Criminal Justice Review. October 2021. doi:10.1177/10575677211041926 which can be accessed here: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10575677211041926.
 Together with Professor Vania Ceccato from KTH and her student Oskar Müller we set out to explore how Twitter profiles of police in Sweden build “exhibitions” of policing for the public to view and interact with.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Knife crime&amp;rdquo; is a term which has come to describe a range of offences where sharp objects, usually knives are involved, which has generated much discourse in media (e.g. BBC), policy (e.g. Home Office), and in academic research.
A commonly highlighted theme in this topic is the lack of trust between young people and police, which leads to young people&amp;rsquo;s worry about knife crime, which impacts on their everyday lives, and on issues of communication between young eople and police.</description>

      <description>Early last autumn I was contacted by the team at Sage Research Methods about their project putting together a Data Visualisation Collection of online resources.
The idea is to create online teaching material (video tutorials, text entries, datasets, and so on) introducing fundamentals of data and design necessary to create impactful visualizations.
To contribute to this resource, I teamed up with Sage to summarise the key learnings from our paper with Dr Sam Langton, Cartograms, hexograms and regular grids: Minimising misrepresentation in spatial data visualisations  in a short video clip.</description>

      <title>A response to: on the safety of women</title>

      <description>The murder of Sarah Everard has horrified everyone across the UK, and has re-ignited discussions about women’s safety in public places. While many point out that something so horrific as murder by a stranger is a rare event, one reaction has been an outpouring of shared experiences of harassment and victimisation.
I wanted to write this post to present the idea of near-misses and highlight that sexual harassment is still something that is hugely underreported.</description>

      <description>This post is about the paper Towards a Place-based Measure of Fear of Crime: A Systematic Review of App-based and Crowdsourcing Approaches available to read on the journal page or pre-print on https://osf.io/49sv7/
 A place-based and context-specific approach to the study of fear of crime is something that I had been thinking about since my PhD when it seemed to me that among the wealth of work on ‘crime and place’ there seems to be little translation of these situational perspectives to the study of fear of crime.</description>

      <description>Back in February someone on Twitter recommended the book Pitch Perfect: How to Say It Right the First Time, Every Time by Bill McGowan and Alisa Bowman. It was still in the time before corona (b.c.) so I went to a physical library (wow) and got a physical copy (wow) and read it while on a weekend getaway (wowowow). While it started out a bit slow (a lot of convincing the reader that the book and tools are useful, like sure it would be great if I could afford some one-to-one coaching from the author, but it’s not likely to happen to me unfortunately…) I found there to be many useful pointers, which can help with presentations and interviews, so I will summarise some below.</description>

      <title>Street Profile Analysis Tutorial</title>

      <description>A while back I posted this tutorial about hot routes for visualising crime along a network (eg tube line). But I mentioned at the end, it may not always be necessary to include the geographic component of this visualisation. Instead, another approach could be to make use of street profile analysis introduced by Valerie Spicer, Justin Song, Patricia Brantingham, Andrew Park, and Martin Andresen in their 2016 paper ‘Street profile analysis: A new method for mapping crime on major roadways’ published in Applied Geography.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I posted this tutorial about hot routes for visualising crime along a network (eg tube line). But I mentioned at the end, it may not always be necessary to include the geographic component of this visualisation. Instead, another approach could be to make use of street profile analysis.
Street profile analysis was initially developed as a method for visualising temporal and spatial crime patterns along major roadways in metropolitan areas.</description>

      <description>Crime concentrates in place and time, and it is the task of the crime analyst to identify where and when these hotspots emerge. This is often achieved by producing density maps. Kernel density estimation is one methdod for producing such maps, which involves applying a function (known as a “kernel”) to each data point, which averages the location of that point with respect to the location of other data points.</description>

      <title>Exploring public engagement with missing person appeals on Twitter</title>

      <description>About this time last year I received funding from the Manchester Statistical Society Campion Grant to carry out some research looking into appeals for informaion made about missing persons on Twitter.
The motivation behind this is that police agencies globally are seeing an increase in reports of people going missing. These people are often vulnerable, and their safe and early return can be a key factor in preventing them from coming to serious harm.</description>

      <title>Introducing data and crime analysis to Wirral Hospitals&#39; School</title>

      <description>On Monday (13th January) I gave a talk introducing pupils of Wirral Hospitals’ School to the world of data analysis, and specifically crime analysis. It was my first time speaking to a younger audience, so I had a bit of a task trying to think about what is the appropriate amount of content to include, and level to pitch to. I didn’t want to be too simplistic and therefore condescending, but I also didn’t want to bore them with jargon and technical details.</description>

      <description>Last week I was at the 2019 annual meeting of the American Society of Criminology (ASC). It was a great opportunity to see friends and colleagues, learn about new developments in the field, and present my paper on environmental features associated with sexual harassment.
This was my 3rd ASC (2nd in sunny San Francisco) but my first without a “crime and place“ stream. This meant that instead of sitting in one room and waiting for the presentations to come to me, I had to curate my own experience.</description>

      <description>Presenting at R Sheffield Last week I had the pleasure to present at the Sheffield R User Group alongside former PhD colleague (and roommate) Joanna Hill who is currently based in Uganda, working remotely at Rutgers University. It was a great event, set in a meeting room upstairs in The Red Deer pub, which gave it a nice informal feel. The attendees were all welcoming, knowedgeable, and very engaged and engaging, so it was a great experience and I recommend to anyone in the area.</description>

      <description>Learning to visualise data Last week I had the opportunity to take a one-week course by Andy Kirk about data visualisation, hosted by Methods at Manchester as part of the Summer School programme. It was a fantastic experience to be a student again, and I learned a lot about practical considerations that go into producing effective visualisations that are trustworthy, accessible, and elegant.
I will not (and cannot) summarise the course here, I recomment anyone interested in creating data visuailisations to get in touch with Andy for courses.</description>
