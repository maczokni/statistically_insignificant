# (a) Balanced cartogram

- From [Harris, R (2017) Hexograms: Better maps of area based data.](https://rpubs.com/profrichharris/hexograms)

--

- Scale by min value to balance **invisibility** and **distortion**

--

- Eg if SIU is 0.02 inches on a 5inch map:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

siu <- 0.02 # the smallest interpretable unit
height <- 5
bb <- sp::bbox(map)
width <- (bb[1,2] - bb[1,1]) / (bb[2,2] - bb[2,1]) * height
bbA <- (bb[1,2] - bb[1,1]) * (bb[2,2] - bb[2, 1])
mapA <- rgeos::gArea(map)
minA <- (siu * bbA) / (height * width)
map$scaleby <- rgeos::gArea(map, byid = TRUE)
map$scaleby[map$scaleby < minA] <- minA
# Use this to scale cartogram
balcarto <- cartogram::cartogram(map, "scaleby", maxSizeError = 1.1, prepare = "none")

```

---

# (b) Hexogram

- same idea as balanced carto, with minimum value being what allows each area to be represented as its own hexagon

--

- hexagons are produced using the hexagonal binning function in R’s fMultivar package, based on the centroids of each polygon

--

- our example: 
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Get the function needed
script <- RCurl::getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/profrichharris/Rhexogram/master/functions.R")
eval(parse(text = script))
# Number of bins guided by the -binN- function for a visual plot.
# 29 is also used by Harris in example.
harris.29  <- hexogram(LAE.sp, 29)
# Extract the hexograms
harris.29.hex.sp <- harris.29[[2]]   # 2 is hexo
```

---

# (c) geogrid squre grid

- From [Joseph Bailey](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geogrid/readme/README.html)

--

- Calculates a grid that strives to preserve the original geography.

--

- 2 steps to using this

  - 1 - Generate grid by varying the seed
  
  - 2 - Efficiently calculate the assignments from the original geography to the new geography
  
--

- Our example: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# step 1 generate grid
LAE.reg <- calculate_grid(shape = LAE.sp, grid_type = "regular", seed = 1) #1 was our fave seed
# step 2 calculate assignments
LAE.reg <- assign_polygons(LAE.sp, LAE.reg) 
```

---

# (d) geogrid hexagonal grid

- Same idea as with grids but for hexagons:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# step 1 generate grid
LAE.hex <- calculate_grid(shape = LAE.sp, grid_type = "hexagonal", seed = 1)

# step 2 calculate assignments
LAE.hex <- assign_polygons(LAE.sp, LAE.hex)

```

---
.center[
# "High values (in yellow) appear to be clustered near one another, with a handful of outliers elsewhere in the country"
]

--

### - 5-point Likert scale (strongly agree, slightly agree, neither agree nor disagree, slightly disagree, strongly disagree). 

--

- Higher agreement = better representation of statement in map 

--

- Convenience sample (internet) of 768 respondents

# Conclusions

- New methods to visualise geographic information **can** convey a message more accurately than original thematic maps.

- But choose the method with consideration to the research question and the data!
