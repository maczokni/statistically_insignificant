## General idea: paying attention to and understanding the near misses can possibly lead to understanding and preventing serious incidents.

# Why is this important?

# Reason 1: 

## Even if near misses do not "predict" more serious incidents, they have consequences in themselves

# Fear of crime also linked with 'near miss'

## Example: FOCApp

> I was on my way into university in the morning, and I was coming into
Euston station and there was someone who looked like they were trying to
remove a bike from the railings that had been locked in, and they didn’t look
like the owners of the bike. And then I suspected they were trying to steal the
bike, so I reported my fear of crime because it was a specific incident of me
seeing what I thought was criminal activity.

## Fear of crime affects:

- equal access to public space

--

- sustainable travel

--

- individual and community wellbeing

---
class: center, middle, inverse

# Reason 2: 

## If near misses predict serious incidents, we can study spatial and temporal patterns of incidents on which we otherwise have sparse data

# Reason 3: 

## By becoming interested in the near misses, we "lower the barrier" to reporting something, providing insight into crimes which are traditionally underreported

# Conclusions: 

--

- Place/ context specific fear of crime events can be thought of as "near misses"
--

- In any case, may be important in themselves as fear of crime events with real consequences
--

- But if near miss may help identify areas of concern/ interest
--

- And may help complement data sources on underreported incidents
