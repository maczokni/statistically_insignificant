# Two techniques for visualising along network

- Hot routes
- Street profile

(return to spatstat solution if time)

---
class: middle, center

# Hot routes

- Developed for crime on public transport

> "it is very difficult to pinpoint the location of a crime that occurs on
a moving vehicle" (Newton, 2014)


---
class: middle, center

# Hot routes

- Application for visualisation with GIS

> "devised with the everyday crime analyst in mind" (Tompson, Partridge & Shepherd, 2009)

---
class: middle, center

# 4 stages

- Step 1. Preparing the network layer
- Step 2. Linking crime events to street segments
- Step 3. Calculating a rate
- Step 4. Visualising the results

---
class: middle, center

# Preparing the network layer (1/2)

```{r}

knitr::kable(mcr_roads[1:3,1:2])

```

---
class: middle, center

# Preparing the network layer (2/2)

```{r}

mcr_roads <- rownames_to_column(mcr_roads, "id")
mcr_roads$id <- as.numeric(as.character(mcr_roads$id ))


```

---
class: middle, center

# Linking events to street segments (1/4)

```{r}
nearest_segments <- st_nearest_feature(mcr_asb, mcr_roads)
```

This new object is simply a list of the ID numbers of matched line segments for each of the ASB incidents. For example here is the ID number of the nearest street segment for the first 5 ASB incidents in our data:

```{r}

nearest_segments[1:5]

```

---
class: middle, center

# Linking events to street segments (2/4)

We can use this to create a frequency table which counds the number of ASB incidents linked to each street segment (by virtue of being nearest to it)

```{r}

#make list of nearest into df of frequency
nearest_freq <- as.data.frame(table(nearest_segments))

#make sure id is numeric
nearest_freq$nearest_segments <- as.numeric(as.character(nearest_freq$nearest_segments))

knitr::kable(nearest_freq[1:3,])

```

---
class: middle, center

# Linking events to street segments (3/4)

```{r}
#join to sections object and replace NAs with 0s
mcr_roads <- left_join(mcr_roads, 
                       nearest_freq,
                       by = c("id" = "nearest_segments")) %>% 
  mutate(Freq = replace_na(Freq, 0))
