<p>This is an <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a> Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.</p>
<p>Try executing this chunk by clicking the <em>Run</em> button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing <em>Cmd+Shift+Enter</em>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(cars)</code></pre>

<p>Add a new chunk by clicking the <em>Insert Chunk</em> button on the toolbar or by pressing <em>Cmd+Option+I</em>.</p>
<p>When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the <em>Preview</em> button or press <em>Cmd+Shift+K</em> to preview the HTML file).</p>
<p>The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike <em>Knit</em>, <em>Preview</em> does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.</p>
