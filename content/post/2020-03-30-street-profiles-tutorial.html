<p>A few days ago I posted [this tutorial about hot routes] for visualising crime along a network (eg tube line). But I mentioned at the end, it may not always be necessary to include the geographic component of this visualisation. Instead, another approach could be to make use of <a href="">street profile analysis</a>.</p>
